ManyWho Java SDK
================

An open source SDK that allows you to easily build plugins and services that integrate with Flows running on
the [ManyWho](https://manywho.com) platform.

## Installation

The SDK is available on Maven and is automatically published there on each release, so it's easy to integrate with your 
Java application:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.manywho</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
    <version>${version.manywho.sdk}</version>
</dependency>
```

The latest version is always available to find on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/manywho/sdk-java/releases).

## Usage

Some initial basic information on how to build a plugin that integrates with ManyWho using this SDK is available on
the [ManyWho Developers](https://developers.manywho.com/display/MA/Building+a+Service) site.
